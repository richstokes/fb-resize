# fb-resize
OSX Script to Automatically resize images for use on Facebook
<br><br>
This is a Mac OSX script to batch convert high quality/high resolution photos from SLRs into the optimum format for Facebook. It uses the sipz program which comes preinstalled with OSX.
<br><br>
Facebook typically crushes the quality of nice photos taken on SLRs or other decent cameras. This script will create a 'fb' sub-directory under your album, copy the originals and then convert them to the <a href="https://fstoppers.com/wedding/how-size-your-images-so-they-show-their-best-facebook-2993" target="_blank">recommended best size</a> for uploading to Facebook. The original files are not touched by this script.
<br><br>

I saved the script below to /opt/local/bin/fb-resize    - any location within your $PATH will work.<br><br>

Then all you need to do run ./fb-resize from a terminal, making sure you first 'cd' into the directory of your photo album.
